    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p>This chicken wing dip tastes just like hot chicken wings, 
        but without the mess. It is perfect for football and tailgating 
        season. I take this whenever I have to bring a dish and am 
        always asked for the recipe. Serve with tortilla chips.
    </p>
